# Applications-of-an-applied-machine-learning-approach-to-predict-the-functional-status-of-water-pumps
The challenge for this problem is to predict the operational condition of the water pumps i.e. whether these pumps are functional, non-functional, or functional but need repair with high accuracy. This problem Uses data from TAARIFA and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water. TAARIFA is an open-source platform for the crowd-sourced reporting and triaging of infrastructure-related issues. The use of advanced technology such as machine learning (ML) has not been explicitly deployed in modeling pumps functionality in developing countries including Tanzania; due to the challenges that come with its datasets such as missing information, data inconsistency, imbalance-class, and other uncertainties. Predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed is a challenging part. Hence, developing an ML model that is capable of predicting which will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania. Also, timely maintenance and repair of water points will be a financially cheaper option for the Govt. authorities rather than replacing a pump.
